# Schedule-organizer

## Description
This webpage was an "on the job ticket" where I was tasked to modify the given code to meet the requirements. This webpage is a schedule, where the user is able to input information for each time block and each time the webpage is loaded, the text will remain thanks to local storage. The work day schdule is organized by color. Green means that that time block is the future, red means it is the present, and gray means that it is the past.
